## API Routes

| Method | Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/submit` | Save participant name, email, message, and timestamp |
| `GET` | `/submissions` | Fetch submissions for the motivation wall |
| `GET` | `/submissions/stream` | Realtime updates for new motivation wall submissions |
| `GET` | `/health` | Check if the API is running |

Admin requests send the `x-admin-secret` header so the dashboard can display participant emails.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_CLUSTER.mongodb.net/she_can_foundation?retryWrites=true&w=majority
ADMIN_SECRET=SHECAN2025
```

This project is already configured locally with the MongoDB Atlas URL you provided.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Node.js from `https://nodejs.org/`.
2. Open a terminal in this project folder.
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the backend and frontend together:

```bash
npm start
```

5. Open the site:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

6. Open the hidden admin dashboard:

```text
http://localhost:5000/admin.html
```

Admin secret code:

```text
SHECAN2025
```

## Development Mode

For automatic server restart while coding:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## MongoDB Notes

The backend connects in `config/db.js` using `process.env.MONGO_URI`.

If MongoDB Atlas blocks the connection, open your Atlas dashboard and go to:

```text
Network Access -> Add IP Address -> Add Current IP Address
```

For classroom demos only, you can temporarily allow access from anywhere with `0.0.0.0/0`. For real projects, use your current IP address instead.

The app also includes an in-memory fallback. This means the website, form, motivation wall, realtime updates, and admin dashboard still work locally even when Atlas blocks the connection. Once Atlas is allowed, new submissions automatically save to MongoDB.

Each form submission is saved with:

- Full name
- Email
- Message / dream / motivation
- Submission date and time through Mongoose `timestamps`

## Internship Presentation Tip

When presenting the project, submit one or two sample participation messages first. Then show the motivation wall updating dynamically and open the admin dashboard to demonstrate the full-stack flow from frontend form to MongoDB to admin view.
